does not serve food very late at night and we couldn't find any vending machines for soda or snacks, so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .\\n6

walk in the dark at night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .\\n8

street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon Center's underground food court 2 blocks south and 2 .\\n10

         Room service was extortionate though, very very expensive, so we didnt bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .\\n11

also did the chicago food tasting tour which you can find here on travelzoo, this was fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .\\n12

that you can store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

passed on the restaurants simply because the cost of breakfast was insane and the food tends to be mediocre .\\n14

                             Also don't forget to go the &quot The River North&quot  for great food .\\n15

         An added bonus was the Executive Lounge with complimentary food throughout the day .\\n16

with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .\\n17

experience here from the quality of the lobby, to the quality of the room, to the view, to the room service, to the food .\\n44

room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food .\\n45

concourse that leads to an underground mini, mall, with a grocery store, fast, food restaurants, barber shop etc .\\n46  , followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasn't out  the hotel's extremely limited cable service    our housekeeper didn't refill replace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay, nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time  our room service on two occasions brought us cold soggy, , and very late, , food  the lobby bar closes at 9 p .\\n47

Food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant   was of good quality .\\n48

crib, a play pen, and a small room refrigerator for storing baby food at NO additional cost .\\n49
